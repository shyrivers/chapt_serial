This project is a record of my learning ROS2.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It provides a serial communication solution for beginners like me^_^
who don't know how to connect ROS2 nodes with mcu such as stm32 of the lower-level devices.

I am using a RaspBerry Pi 5,which is running Ubuntu 24.04 and the ROS2 Jazzy.
"
 sudo apt install ros-jazzy-serial-driver
"
use it to install the serial driver,enable to communicate with the computer or MCU 
using the USB-to-TTL module,like uart.
